# Hold Me

**Experimental: No stable version of this package yet exists; it is still in
early development.**

Package holdme contains some generic structures for holding values. I plan to
add to this over time as I need things.

[API Documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/gholt/holdme)  

This is the latest development area for the package.  
Eventually a stable version of the package will be established but, for now,
all things about this package are subject to change.
